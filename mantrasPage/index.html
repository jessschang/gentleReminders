<h1>Mantras</h1>

<div class="page-descriptor">

	<p>Chakra mantras help you to clear your energy pathways so you can thrive, not just survive — allowing you to make the most of your physical life experience, creating positive physical, emotional, mental and spiritual change.</p>
</div>


	<section class="mantra-carousel">
		<div class="cleansing chakra1">
			<h3>LAM — Root Chakra.</h3> 
			<p>The cleansing mantra chanted for your Root Chakra, which keeps us grounded and linked to the earth.

			Chanting this mantra will cleanse impurities that can collect in the root chakra – literally opening you up to feelings of security, prosperity and belonging – and clearing any blocked energy that is being prevented from moving through to the other six main energy centers.

		Chant “LAM” if your energy is low, you struggle financially, you suffer from low self-esteem and you suffer from adrenal fatigue and other stress-related ailments.</p>
</div>

<div class="cleansing chakra2">
	<h3>VAM — Sacral Chakra</h3>
	<p>The cleansing mantra for your Sacral Chakra, which is associated with sexuality, pleasure and creativity.

Opening this chakra will open you up to others, give you the courage to express yourself and to embrace change.

Chant “VAM” if you have poor self-image, find it hard to open up in relationships, feel unsatisfied sexually and suffer from low libido.</p>

</div>


<div class="cleansing chakra3">
	<h3>RAM — Solar Plexus Chakra</h3>
	<p>This opens your Solar Plexus Chakra, the seat of your personal power.

	Chanting “RAM” will increase your ability to stand up for yourself, control negative impulses, and exercise greater self-control.

	Your self-esteem will increase as you chant “RAM” and you will become more confident and self-assured – and your frequent stomach anxiety and pains will subside!</p> </div>
</div>

<div class="cleansing chakra4">
	<h3>YAM— Heart Chakra</h3>
	<p>The cleansing mantra for your Heart Chakra. You give and receive love through the energy center that is your heart chakra.

If you’re not feeling loving, lovable, compassionate or experience relationships difficulties, you could use some YAM!

Chant “YAM” to heal both the physical heart and the spiritual (emotional) heart center and open yourself up to unconditional love and compassion.</p> </div>

<div class="cleansing chakra5">
	<h3>HAM — Throat Chakra</h3>
	<p>The mantra to unblock your Throat Chakra. This is your physical and spiritual voice, your means of communicating who you are and what you need and want from yourself and the universe.

The throat chakra governs your ability to express yourself. If it’s closed, you will find yourself frequently frustrated as you cannot voice your needs and desires (closing yourself off to opportunities and having your needs met). A closed throat chakra makes honesty and integrity difficult traits to embody.

The vibrations from “RAM” will open your throat chakra so that your communication energy can flow strongly.</p> </div>

<div class="cleansing chakra6">
	<h3>AUM (or OM) — Third Eye Chakra</h3>
	<p>This opens your Third Eye Chakra, which is at the center of your forehead and is directly in line with the center of your brain.

While OM is one of the most common mantras and can be used for a wide variety of mantra meditations, it is particularly important to the cleansing and healing of your third eye chakra. The third eye chakra (or brow chakra) is the seat of intuition and life purpose.

Chanting “OM” will break loose the constraints that you have imposed upon yourself by not allowing yourself to listen to your inner wisdom and using that wisdom to chart the best course for a life of purpose and passion.</p> </div>

<div class="cleansing chakra7">
	<h3>OM or AH — Crown Chakra</h3>
	<p>The mantras for your Crown Chakra, the connection to the divine.

A closed crown chakra brings about feelings of insignificance and pointlessness, leading to a disconnect from spirit (Universe/Source/God) and an overly strong attachment to possessions, relationships, and the physical world. Some find that silence is a more effective practice for opening the crown chakra but OM may be used to open it as well.

Chanting AH represents a release. Think about taking a deep breath, then letting it go. AH is the sound of releasing and letting go.</p> </div>
